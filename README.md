**Corpus Description**
My corpus consists of 2 playlist of songs that i listen to of western pop songs and k-pop songs that contain 50 tracks each, and 2 playlists of western and k-pop songs in general. The reason I chose this is because iâ€™m an avid listener of kpop and I have some favourite pop songs. My reason for choosing my corpus is because I want to figure out the differences between western pop songs and the ever more popular kpop genre and also what makes me like certain pop songs and if there exists a common factor within kpop and western pop songs that i like. I will be choosing the personal mix for kpop and western pop and furthermore curated playlists for kpop and western pop made by spotify themselves. This assures represenativeness. Furthermore there are no atypical songs in the corpus that is chosen
