**Corpus Description**

My corpus consists of 2 playlist of songs that i listen to of western pop songs and k-pop songs that contain 50 tracks each, and 2 playlists of western and k-pop songs in general. The reason I chose this is because iâ€™m an avid listener of kpop and I have some favourite pop songs. My reason for choosing my corpus is because I want to figure out the differences between western pop songs and the ever more popular kpop genre and also what makes me like certain pop songs and if there exists a common factor within kpop and western pop songs that i like. I will be choosing the personal mix for kpop and western pop and furthermore curated playlists for kpop and western pop made by spotify themselves. This assures represenativeness. Furthermore there are no atypical songs in the corpus that is chosen

**Description Plot: Energy Difference between Krnb and Kpop*

In this plot I pulled in data of 2 playlists. One being a KRnB playlist and the other one being a KPOP playlist. For these playlists i hypothesised that the KPOP playlist would have a higher mean energy lever than the krnb playlist. This hypothesis turned out to be true when looking at the histogram plot. Besides the mean energy level indeed being higher for KPOP songs, you can also see a slight overlap with some krnb and kpop songs having the same energy levels. An interesting finding is that there are some krnb songs that fall in the upper spectrum of the energy level of even KPOP songs. In the future i would like to find out which songs they are and if they "feel" like krnb and are even made by artists that are known to release krnb songs.
